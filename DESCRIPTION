Description: Interlinearized glossed texts (IGT) are used in descriptive linguistics for
 representing a morphological analysis of a text through a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss.
 'InterlineaR' provide a set of functions that targets several popular formats of IGT
 ('SIL Toolbox', 'EMELD XML') and that turns an IGT into a set of data frames following
 a relational model (the tables represent the different linguistic units: texts,
 sentences, word, morphems).
 The same pieces of software ('SIL FLEX', 'SIL Toolbox') typically produce dictionaries
 of the morphemes used in the glosses. 'InterlineaR' provide a function for turning
 the LIFT XML dictionary format into a set of data frames following a relational model
 in order to represent the dictionary entries, the sense(s) attached to the entries,
 the example(s) attached to senses, etc.
